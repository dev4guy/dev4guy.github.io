| Text Operator              | Description                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| = and == (Equal)           | Evaluates if two values are equivalent. The = and == operator are interchangeable.                                                   |
| <> and != (Not Equal)      | Evaluates if two values are not equivalent.                                                                                          |
| < (Less Than)              | Evaluates if a value is less than the value that follows this symbol.                                                                |
| > (Greater Than)           | Evaluates if a value is greater than the value that follows this symbol.                                                             |
| <= (Less Than or Equal)    | Evaluates if a value is less than or equal to the value that follows this symbol.                                                    |
| >= (Greater Than or Equal) | Evaluates if a value is greater than or equal to the value that follows this symbol.                                                 |
| && (AND)                   | Evaluates if two values or expressions are both true. Use this operator as an alternative to the logical function AND.               |
| \|\| (OR)                  | Evaluates if at least one of multiple values or expressions is true. Use this operator as an alternative to the logical function OR. |
